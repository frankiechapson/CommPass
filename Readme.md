# CommPass, i.e. Command Passing

## This is a Delphi application to emulate typing

## Why?
Because Iâ€™ve had enough of having to constantly look for different commands and I even have to type or copy-paste to the right place.
The program here will help with this problem.
I just put the XML as a sample, of course it is free to edit.

## How

to use **ComPass**?

Just drag the necessary line and drop it where you need it and the text will appear there just as you would have typed

For example like this:

![CommPass](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39552762/92737511-80768780-f37b-11ea-9586-36d83eb250b2.png)

# Exe version
Here is the complied exe:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hAUgXvj4DJPT4usZZSDy9YwL7gI8NET8

the **ComPass** works?

When the program starts, it builds up the GUI from the **CommPass.XML** file in the same directory with it. (just
must be restarted at startup, i.e. after xml editing, there is no refresh)
I put a sample xml there.

**TAB**s will become TABs.


**Comment** lines appear in red and cannot move.

There are two ways to drop a string:

**KBDEMU**: writes the string to the keyboard buffer. This is worth using less often because though
doing it the standard Windows way, many of the programs aren't even prepared to do it right
handle these messages so that they are absorbed after a specified length. However, it is not
goes differently, eg in Windows CMD window.

**CP**, i.e. copy-paste. Put the string on the clipboard, then the string specified in "With" with kbd
put it in the buffer. Since it's usually not too long, there's no problem with programs yet.

What you need to know about the keyboard string. In **KBDEMU** mode, use the special tokens for the following tokens
can be used. See below!

In copy-paste mode, only the

    {LT}    = < (less than)
    {GT}    = > (greater than)
    {AT}    = @ (at)
    {ENTER} = CHR(13)

implemented because so far I only needed these, but you can add something else if needed, of course
only if there is a character equivalent.
(you can see a lot of examples of different uses in XML)

Supported modifiers:

    + = Shift
    ^ = Control
    % = Alt
    ! = AltGr

Supported special characters

    { = Begin key name text (see below)
    } = End key name text (see below)

Supported characters:

Supported key names (surround these with braces):

    LT = < (less than)
    GT = > (greater than)
    AT = @ (at)
